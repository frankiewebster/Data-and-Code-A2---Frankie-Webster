**The Singing Toothbrush Timer:** 

The Singing Toothbrush Timer is designed for kids to enjoy and learn while cleaning their teeth. Designed to function from a micro:bit, once started it will play a song for 120 seconds. However, at every 30 seconds, a new sound will play, indicating to change quadrants or sides of the mouth; this will be repeated 3 times. Once completed, the micro:bit will stop, and the teeth cleaning will be done. While it is still a working prototype, all the functions work properly. However, some improvements/extensions could be made if time allows. 

**Technologies Used:**

Project is used with: 

*Make Code software*: 
  makecode.microbit.org version:  7.0.51
  Microsoft MakeCode version:  11.1.5
  microbit runtime version:  v2.2.0-rc6
  codal-microbit-v2 runtime version:  v0.2.68

 *Microbit hardware*: 
  micro:bit v2.21 
  battery pack 

**Setup**: 

To run this project, a V2 and/or V1 micro bit is needed and its other requirements provided in the box: 
1. Cord provided 
2. Battery pack and AAA batteries 
3. USBC to USB connector if required

*If using a V1 micro:bit*: 
1. Corded headphones
2. Crocodile Clips 

*If using a V2 microbit*:
1. Download the provided code as a hex file onto your computer.
2. Insert the V2 micro:bit to your laptop.
3. Drag and drop the hex file to the micro:bit drive
4. The program now should run. 
5. To use it without the laptop, complete steps above and safely eject the micro:bit drive
6. Plug the battery back provided in the micro:bit box into the micro:bit and play.
7. This can now be transported anywhere.
Please note, the clear plastic protetcive case does not fit on the V2 micro:bit due to the speaker on the back.

*If using a V1 micro:bit*: 
1. Complete steps 1-7 steps mentioned above.
2. To play the sound externally, gather crocidle clips.
3. Connect the first crocodile clip to the GND pin and the second crocodile clip to the 0 pin
4. Connnect the GND mounted clip to the tip of te headphone jack and connect the 0 pin clip to the base of the jack.
5. The sound should now play through the headphones after pressing a on the Micro:bit V1

**Project Status**: 

Prototyping Stage 

**Features**: 

1. Press b to mute song, star and images every 30 seconds will still play
2. Press a and b to turn volume back on
3. Every 30 seconds of the song, a new sound and image will play, indicating that a new side of the mouth is to be brushed. 

**Room for Improvement**: 

1. No button can currently pause the timer; only mute it.
2. One song is only programmed to play, so this may become boring for the user when used twice a day.
3. V1 provides too many cords and removes level of safety and feasability
4. Protective case does not fit on V2 micro:bit
5. Waterproof bag is too big for both micro:bit's - design and produce a tight fitting sleeve

**Usage**

This is intended to be used in a bathroom setting as it is used for a toothbrush timer. 
Although, due to its portability it can be used in many other environments. 
Please note that the micro:bit is not waterproof.

*Please note my structure of code in Python viewing resets to its default viewing of blocks every time it is accessed, which changes the formation of my code and comments; while my code functions remain the same, the order gets moved. Please refer to my video and the code screenshots to see its correct format* 

**This project was inspired by** 

The song was inspired by twinkle twinkle little star, correctly targeting the key public. The Lullaby vibe of the song reflects a night-time routine and early morning. 
The image of the star on the micro:bit also reflects this. 
This has also been inspired by a toothbrush I used to have as a child; it used to play a song sung by Rhianna and have positive connotations to those memories.
