**##The Singing Toothbrush Timer:** 

The Singing Toothbrush Timer is designed for kids to enjoy and learn while cleaning their teeth. Designed to function from a micro:bit, once started it will play a song for 120 seconds. However, at every 30 seconds, a new sound will play, indicating to change quadrants or sides of the mouth; this will be repeated 3 times. Once completed, the micro:bit will stop, and the teeth cleaning will be done. While it is still a working prototype, all the functions work properly. However, some improvements/extensions could be made if time allows.

**Technologies Used:**
Project is used with: 

* Make Code software: 
  makecode.microbit.org version:  7.0.51

  Microsoft MakeCode version:  11.1.5

  microbit runtime version:  v2.2.0-rc6

  codal-microbit-v2 runtime version:  v0.2.68

* Microbit hardware: 
  micro:bit v2.21 
  battery pack 

**Setup**: 
To run this project, a V2 and/or V1 microbit is needed and its other requirements provided in the box: 
1. cord
2. 

* If using a V2 microbit:
1. Download the provided code as a hex file onto your computer.
2. Insert the V2 micro:bit to your laptop.
3. Drag and drop the hex file to the micro:bit drive
4. The program now should run. 
5. To use it without the laptop, complete steps above and safely eject the micro:bit drive
6. Plug the battery back provided in the micro:bit box into the micro:bit and play.
7. This can now be transported anywhere.
Please note, the clear plastic protetcive case does not fit on the V2 micro:bit due to the speaker on the back.

*If using a V1 micro:bit: 
Complete steps 1-7 steps mentioned above. 
8. To play the sound externally, download the micro:bit app onto your phone 
9. Once downloaded, press manage connections in the app
10. Follow the steps provided. 
11. The sound now should play through your phone using its Bluetooth features.

**Project Status**: 
Prototyping Stage 

**Features**: 
Press b to mute song, star and images every 30 seconds will still play 
Press a and b to turn volume back on 
Every 30 seconds of the song, a new sound and image will play, indicating that a new side of the mouth is to be brushed. 

**Room for Improvement**: 
No button can currently pause the timer; only mute it. 
One song is only programmed to play, so this may become boring for the user when used twice a day.
