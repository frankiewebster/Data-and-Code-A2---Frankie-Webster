**The Singing Toothbrush Timer:** 

The Singing Toothbrush Timer is designed for kids to enjoy and learn while cleaning their teeth. Designed to function from a micro:bit, once started it will play a song for 120 seconds. However, at every 30 seconds, a new sound will play, indicating to change quadrants or sides of the mouth; this will be repeated 3 times. Once completed, the micro:bit will stop, and the teeth cleaning will be done. While it is still a working prototype, all the functions work properly. However, some improvements/extensions could be made if time allows. 

**Technologies Used:**

Project is used with: 

*Make Code software*: 
  makecode.microbit.org version:  7.0.51
  Microsoft MakeCode version:  11.1.5
  microbit runtime version:  v2.2.0-rc6
  codal-microbit-v2 runtime version:  v0.2.68

 *Microbit hardware*: 
  micro:bit v2.21 
  battery pack 

**Setup**: 

To run this project, a V2 and/or V1 micro bit is needed and its other requirements provided in the box: 
1. Cord provided 
2. Battery pack and AAA batteries 
3. USBC to USB connector if required

*If using a V1 micro:bit*: 
1. Corded headphones
2. Crocodile Clips 

*If using a V2 microbit*:
1. Download the provided code as a hex file onto your computer.
2. Insert the V2 micro:bit to your laptop.
3. Drag and drop the hex file to the micro:bit drive
4. The program now should run. 
5. To use it without the laptop, complete steps above and safely eject the micro:bit drive
6. Plug the battery back provided in the micro:bit box into the micro:bit and play.
7. This can now be transported anywhere.
Please note, the clear plastic protetcive case does not fit on the V2 micro:bit due to the speaker on the back.

*If using a V1 micro:bit*: 
1. Complete steps 1-7.
2. To play the sound externally, gather crocodile clips.
3. Connect the first crocodile clip to the GND pin and the second crocodile clip to the 0-pin
4. Connect the GND-mounted clip to the tip of the headphone jack and connect the 0-pin clip to the jack base.
5. The sound should now play through the headphones after pressing an on the Micro:bit V1 

*Please note a toothbrush is not technically needed to run this project*

**Project Status**: 

Prototyping Stage 

**Features**: 

1. Press b to mute song, star and images every 30 seconds will still play
2. Press a and b to turn volume back on
3. Every 30 seconds of the song, a new sound and image will play, indicating that a new side of the mouth is to be brushed. 

**Room for Improvement**: 

1. No button can currently pause the timer; only mute it.
2. One song is only programmed to play, so this may become boring for the user when used twice a day.
3. V1 provides too many cords and removes level of safety and feasability
4. Protective case does not fit on V2 micro:bit
5. Waterproof bag is too big for both micro:bit's - design and produce a tight fitting sleeve

**Usage**

This is intended to be used in a bathroom setting as it is used for a toothbrush timer. 
However, due to its portability, it can be used in many other environments. 
Please note that the micro:bit is not waterproof.

*Please note my structure of code in Python viewing may reset to its default viewing of blocks every time it is accessed, which changes the formation of my code and comments; while my code functions remain the same, the order gets moved.

**This project was inspired by** 

The song was inspired by twinkle twinkle little star, correctly targeting the key public. The Lullaby vibe of the song reflects a night-time routine and early morning. 
The image of the star on the micro:bit also reflects this. 
This has also been inspired by a toothbrush I used to have as a child; it used to play a song sung by Rhianna and have positive connotations to those memories.
